    "At this point, you should have a firm idea of what your data science problem is and have the data you believe could help solve it. The business problem was a general one of modeling resort revenue. The data you started with contained some ticket price values, but with a number of missing values that led to several rows being dropped completely. You also had two kinds of ticket price. There were also some obvious issues with some of the other features in the data that, for example, led to one column being completely dropped, a data error corrected, and some other rows dropped. You also obtained some additional US state population and size data with which to augment the dataset, which also required some cleaning.\n",

    "New York dominates the area of skiing available at night. Looking at the top five in general, they are all the more northerly states. Is night skiing in and of itself an appeal to customers, or is a consequence of simply trying to extend the skiing day where days are shorter? Is New York's domination here because it's trying to maximize its appeal to visitors who'd travel a shorter distance for a shorter visit? You'll find the data generates more (good) questions rather than answering them. This is a positive sign! You might ask your executive sponsor or data provider for some additional data about typical length of stays at these resorts, although you might end up with data that is very granular and most likely proprietary to each resort. A useful level of granularity might be \"number of day tickets\" and \"number of weekly passes\" sold."

The season will only be so long, and so the more resorts open through the skiing season, the more total days open we'll see. New Hampshire makes a good effort at making it into the top five, for a small state that didn't make it into the top five of resorts per state. Does its location mean resorts there have a longer season and so stay open longer, despite there being fewer of them?"

    "There are big states which are not necessarily the most populous. There are states that host many resorts, but other states host a larger total skiing area. The states with the most total days skiing per season are not necessarily those with the most resorts. And New York State boasts an especially large night skiing area. New York had the most resorts but wasn't in the top five largest states, so the reason for it having the most resorts can't be simply having lots of space for them. New York has the second largest population behind California. Perhaps many resorts have sprung up in New York because of the population size? Does this mean there is a high competition between resorts in New York State, fighting for customers and thus keeping prices down? You're not concerned, per se, with the absolute size or population of a state, but you could be interested in the ratio of resorts serving a given population or a given area.\n",

This technique will find linear combinations of the original features that are uncorrelated with one another and order them by the amount of variance they explain. You can use these derived features to visualize the data in a lower dimension (e.g. 2 down from 7) and know how much variance the representation explains. You can also explore how the original features contribute to these derived features."

    "The above scatterplot was created using matplotlib. This is powerful, but took quite a bit of effort to set up. You have to iterate over the categories, plotting each separately, to get a colour legend. You can also tell that the points in the legend have different sizes as well as colours. As it happens, the size and the colour will be a 1:1 mapping here, so it happily works for us here. If we were using size and colour to display fundamentally different aesthetics, you'd have a lot more work to do. So matplotlib is powerful, but not ideally suited to when we want to visually explore multiple features as here (and intelligent use of colour, point size, and even shape can be incredibly useful for EDA).\n",

In the previous notebook, you `melt`ed the data to make it longer, but with fewer columns, in order to get a single column of price with a new column representing a categorical feature you'd want to use. A **key skill** is being able to wrangle data into a form most suited to the particular use case."

You may not always be interested in interpreting the coefficients of the PCA transformation in this way, although it's more likely you will when using PCA for EDA as opposed to a preprocessing step as part of a machine learning pipeline. The attribute is actually a numpy ndarray, and so has been stripped of helpful index and column names. Fortunately, you thought ahead and saved these. This is how we were able to annotate the scatter plots above. It also means you can construct a DataFrame of `components_` with the feature names for context:"

    "hmm, interesting. so actually New York did pretty good in those 2 areas, *BUT* the features it did really strongly in in PC1 had NEGATIVE weights in PC2, so HAVING SUCH HIGH DOMINATING VALUES REALLY PULLED IT DOWN / SET IT BACK!! it's interesting, it works both ways, but it kind of needs to cuz the whole point of this is to create separation / divisions so you can see distinct clusters, and of course, NY is in a world all on its own. NY's large values were responsible for much of the POSITIVE variance in PC1 and much of the NEGATIVE variance in PC2. And actually note that the most negatively weighted feature is one we haven't looked at yet in this bit: night skiing acres. So NY probably did really well in there, if not highest, which def would be the cause for it 'sinking to the bottom' in PC2:"

    "Having previously spent some time exploring the state summary data you derived, you now start to explore the resort-level data in more detail. This can help guide you on how (or whether) to use the state labels in the data. It's now time to merge the two datasets and engineer some intuitive features. For example, you can engineer a resort's share of the supply for a given state."

    "There is a lot to take away from this. First, summit and base elevation are quite highly correlated. This isn't a surprise. You can also see that you've introduced a lot of multicollinearity with your new ratio features; they are negatively correlated with the number of resorts in each state. This latter observation makes sense! If you increase the number of resorts in a state, the share of all the other state features will drop for each. An interesting observation in this region of the heatmap is that there is some positive correlation between the ratio of night skiing area with the number of resorts per capita. In other words, it seems that when resorts are more densely located with population, more night skiing is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning your attention to your target feature, `AdultWeekend` ticket price, you see quite a few reasonable correlations. `fastQuads` stands out, along with `Runs` and `Snow Making_ac`. The last one is interesting. Visitors would seem to value more guaranteed snow, which would cost in terms of snow making equipment, which would drive prices and costs up. Of the new features, `resort_night_skiing_state_ratio` seems the most correlated with ticket price. If this is true, then perhaps seizing a greater share of night skiing capacity is positive for the price a resort can charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as `Runs`, `total_chairs` is quite well correlated with ticket price. This is plausible; the more runs you have, the more chairs you'd need to ferry people to them! Interestingly, they may count for more than the total skiable terrain area. For sure, the total skiable terrain area is not as useful as the area with snow making. People seem to put more value in guaranteed snow cover rather than more variable terrain area.\n",

    "In the scatterplots you see what some of the high correlations were clearly picking up on. There's a strong positive correlation with `vertical_drop`. `fastQuads` seems very useful. `Runs` and `total_chairs` appear quite similar and also useful. `resorts_per_100kcapita` shows something interesting that you don't see from just a headline correlation figure. When the value is low, there is quite a variability in ticket price, although it's capable of going quite high. Ticket price may drop a little before then climbing upwards as the number of resorts per capita increases. Ticket price could climb with the number of resorts serving a population because it indicates a popular area for skiing with plenty of demand. The lower ticket price when fewer resorts serve a population may similarly be because it's a less popular state for skiing. The high price for some resorts when resorts are rare (relative to the population size) may indicate areas where a small number of resorts can benefit from a monopoly effect. It's not a clear picture, although we have some interesting signs."

You have the numbers of various chairs, and the number of runs, but you don't have the ratio of chairs to runs. It seems logical that this ratio would inform you how easily, and thus how *quickly*, people could get to their next ski slope! Create these features now."

    "At first these relationships are quite counterintuitive. It seems that the more chairs a resort has to move people around, relative to the number of runs, ticket price rapidly plummets and stays low. What we may be seeing here is an exclusive vs. mass market resort effect; if you don't have so many chairs, you can charge more for your tickets, although with fewer chairs you're inevitably going to be able to serve fewer visitors. Your price per visitor is high but your number of visitors may be low. Something very useful that's missing from the data is the number of visitors per year.\n",

Was there any pattern suggested of a relationship between state and ticket price? What did this lead us to decide regarding which features to use in subsequent modeling? What aspects of the data (e.g. relationships between features) should you remain wary of when you come to perform feature selection for modeling? Two key points that must be addressed are the choice of target feature for your modelling and how, if at all, you're going to handle the states labels in the data."

    "Summary of the Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on our state-by-state summary, where we narrowed in on 5 key, summarized (summed) features and added 2 other features that we pulled in from an external database\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance we noticed that New York seemed to be dominating the show, and that our state, Montana, was pretty low in the ranks for many (but not all) features. In at least one it was among the top\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So to make the comparison more fair, we put those external data to use to derive 2 new features in attempt to normalize and contextualize the data to show how each state stacked \"pound-for-pound,\" i.e. for their size, in terms of how many resorts they had, both on a per capita and per area basis. We subsequently replaced those original 2 external features with these derived ones. We scaled these features \"up\" so as to make the numbers not be very small and looked at it as resorts per 100k people and per 100k square miles. Smaller states that misleadingly showed small absolute numbers on the original scale, really shined and rose to prominence here - like New Hampshire & Vermont most notably\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We sliced the data in different ways, adding more temporary derived features for exploration, such as percent of total acres that were night skiing acres, to see what things could possibly be important factors in determining price. There was a very noticeably wide spread of days open\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to help us narrow in on what's important, we performed PCA - Principle Component Analysis. We scaled the data down through a function that automatically took care of mean-centering and standardizing (dividing by standard deviation). Then we used the PCA function to fit a line / Principle Components to these 7-dimensional points. Then we looked at the variance explained by each of the 7 principle components and confirmed it looked good - the first 2 accounted for over 75% of the total variance. Then we applied the transformation of the data into the 7 new PC's / derived features to get our *new* coordinates. These new set of 7 coordinates for each state were scores that generated through a sum of the products of the original scaled features and their respective weights, which are their importance/significance in each respective PC. For each of the 7 PC's, there were 7 features/weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first two Principle Components accounted for a large majority of the variance, we felt safe to only focus on those two for easy 2-dimensional plotting as a fair representation of the data. The idea when we have several dimensions, when we can't plot them all, is to compress / flatten / reduce the dimensions and focus on the most important factors, the features that cause the most division / are the most defining. The resultant plot ideally breaks out the population into clusters so we can see overall, based on the 7 features combined, where each state stands relative to each other. Ideally like is grouped with like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon first try, there didn't seem to be a lot of clustering, except for 2 notable islands - New Hampshire / Vermont and then New York all by itself. These seemed to make sense as the former scored very highly in the per capita / per area features and New York dominated in several features. We were able to confirm what we saw when we looked at the .components_ method of the PCA function that showed us the weights / coefficients assigned to each feature in each PC\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if we could do anything else to help bring our plot to life and reveal some patterns, we added a stat for average ticket price, thinking that may have to do with something, but it also did not reveal anything clear\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We looked at correlations between all combined features in a heatmap and found some potentially interesting trends. Then we narrowed it in to just look at the relationships/correlations with ticket price specifically (AdultWeekendPrice). To learn more, maybe we need to tweak our data and fields we look at. Originally, we chose to focus in on a few different fields, but it seems like the more valuable ones are other ones, like runs, fastQuads, vert drop, snow making acres, total chairs, days open, longest run. In fact, only *one* of these was among the features we selected. So it may be worthwhile doing something similar to what we did but, rather than on a STATE basis, which may blur / blend some key details we seek, do it on individual basis. Even with the last set of features we focused on, we may have been better served looking at the ENTIRE population, not just state summaries. Perhaps that was too general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, by only targeting the first 2 Principle Components that explain 75% of the variance, it may help us to look at more principle components to see what more separation/clustering we can arrive at. Also it could benefit us to use some different custom, calculated variables\n",
    "\n",
    "State labels are only relevant if we look at the data in terms of states, which I do not think we should do. But if we did, I would say keep them as this makes it much easier to know what we're looking at. The good thing is the state can easily be toggled back and forth between a column and the index"
