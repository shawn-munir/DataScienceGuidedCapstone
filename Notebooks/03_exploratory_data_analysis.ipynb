    "At this point, you should have a firm idea of what your data science problem is and have the data you believe could help solve it. The business problem was a general one of modeling resort revenue. The data you started with contained some ticket price values, but with a number of missing values that led to several rows being dropped completely. You also had two kinds of ticket price. There were also some obvious issues with some of the other features in the data that, for example, led to one column being completely dropped, a data error corrected, and some other rows dropped. You also obtained some additional US state population and size data with which to augment the dataset, which also required some cleaning.\n",

    "New York dominates the area of skiing available at night. Looking at the top five in general, they are all the more northerly states. Is night skiing in and of itself an appeal to customers, or is a consequence of simply trying to extend the skiing day where days are shorter? Is New York's domination here because it's trying to maximize its appeal to visitors who'd travel a shorter distance for a shorter visit? You'll find the data generates more (good) questions rather than answering them. This is a positive sign! You might ask your executive sponsor or data provider for some additional data about typical length of stays at these resorts, although you might end up with data that is very granular and most likely proprietary to each resort. A useful level of granularity might be \"number of day tickets\" and \"number of weekly passes\" sold."

The season will only be so long, and so the more resorts open through the skiing season, the more total days open we'll see. New Hampshire makes a good effort at making it into the top five, for a small state that didn't make it into the top five of resorts per state. Does its location mean resorts there have a longer season and so stay open longer, despite there being fewer of them?"

    "There are big states which are not necessarily the most populous. There are states that host many resorts, but other states host a larger total skiing area. The states with the most total days skiing per season are not necessarily those with the most resorts. And New York State boasts an especially large night skiing area. New York had the most resorts but wasn't in the top five largest states, so the reason for it having the most resorts can't be simply having lots of space for them. New York has the second largest population behind California. Perhaps many resorts have sprung up in New York because of the population size? Does this mean there is a high competition between resorts in New York State, fighting for customers and thus keeping prices down? You're not concerned, per se, with the absolute size or population of a state, but you could be interested in the ratio of resorts serving a given population or a given area.\n",

This technique will find linear combinations of the original features that are uncorrelated with one another and order them by the amount of variance they explain. You can use these derived features to visualize the data in a lower dimension (e.g. 2 down from 7) and know how much variance the representation explains. You can also explore how the original features contribute to these derived features."

    "Ah, Rhode Island. How has this happened? Recall you created the original ski resort state summary dataset in the previous step before removing resorts with missing prices. This made sense because you wanted to capture all the other available information. However, Rhode Island only had one resort and its price was missing. You have two choices here. If you're interested in looking for any pattern with price, drop this row. But you are also generally interested in any clusters or trends, then you'd like to see Rhode Island even if the ticket price is unknown. So, replace these missing values to make it easier to handle/display them."

    "The above scatterplot was created using matplotlib. This is powerful, but took quite a bit of effort to set up. You have to iterate over the categories, plotting each separately, to get a colour legend. You can also tell that the points in the legend have different sizes as well as colours. As it happens, the size and the colour will be a 1:1 mapping here, so it happily works for us here. If we were using size and colour to display fundamentally different aesthetics, you'd have a lot more work to do. So matplotlib is powerful, but not ideally suited to when we want to visually explore multiple features as here (and intelligent use of colour, point size, and even shape can be incredibly useful for EDA).\n",

A **key skill** is being able to wrangle data into a form most suited to the particular use case."

You may not always be interested in interpreting the coefficients of the PCA transformation in this way, although it's more likely you will when using PCA for EDA as opposed to a preprocessing step as part of a machine learning pipeline. The attribute is actually a numpy ndarray, and so has been stripped of helpful index and column names. Fortunately, you thought ahead and saved these. This is how we were able to annotate the scatter plots above. It also means you can construct a DataFrame of `components_` with the feature names for context:"

    "There is a lot to take away from this. First, summit and base elevation are quite highly correlated. This isn't a surprise. You can also see that you've introduced a lot of multicollinearity with your new ratio features; they are negatively correlated with the number of resorts in each state. This latter observation makes sense! If you increase the number of resorts in a state, the share of all the other state features will drop for each. An interesting observation in this region of the heatmap is that there is some positive correlation between the ratio of night skiing area with the number of resorts per capita. In other words, it seems that when resorts are more densely located with population, more night skiing is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning your attention to your target feature, `AdultWeekend` ticket price, you see quite a few reasonable correlations. `fastQuads` stands out, along with `Runs` and `Snow Making_ac`. The last one is interesting. Visitors would seem to value more guaranteed snow, which would cost in terms of snow making equipment, which would drive prices and costs up. Of the new features, `resort_night_skiing_state_ratio` seems the most correlated with ticket price. If this is true, then perhaps seizing a greater share of night skiing capacity is positive for the price a resort can charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as `Runs`, `total_chairs` is quite well correlated with ticket price. This is plausible; the more runs you have, the more chairs you'd need to ferry people to them! Interestingly, they may count for more than the total skiable terrain area. For sure, the total skiable terrain area is not as useful as the area with snow making. People seem to put more value in guaranteed snow cover rather than more variable terrain area.\n",

    "In the scatterplots you see what some of the high correlations were clearly picking up on. There's a strong positive correlation with `vertical_drop`. `fastQuads` seems very useful. `Runs` and `total_chairs` appear quite similar and also useful. `resorts_per_100kcapita` shows something interesting that you don't see from just a headline correlation figure. When the value is low, there is quite a variability in ticket price, although it's capable of going quite high. Ticket price may drop a little before then climbing upwards as the number of resorts per capita increases. Ticket price could climb with the number of resorts serving a population because it indicates a popular area for skiing with plenty of demand. The lower ticket price when fewer resorts serve a population may similarly be because it's a less popular state for skiing. The high price for some resorts when resorts are rare (relative to the population size) may indicate areas where a small number of resorts can benefit from a monopoly effect. It's not a clear picture, although we have some interesting signs."

    "Finally, think of some further features that may be useful in that they relate to how easily a resort can transport people around. You have the numbers of various chairs, and the number of runs, but you don't have the ratio of chairs to runs. It seems logical that this ratio would inform you how easily, and so quickly, people could get to their next ski slope! Create these features now."

    "At first these relationships are quite counterintuitive. It seems that the more chairs a resort has to move people around, relative to the number of runs, ticket price rapidly plummets and stays low. What we may be seeing here is an exclusive vs. mass market resort effect; if you don't have so many chairs, you can charge more for your tickets, although with fewer chairs you're inevitably going to be able to serve fewer visitors. Your price per visitor is high but your number of visitors may be low. Something very useful that's missing from the data is the number of visitors per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also appears that having no fast quads may limit the ticket price, but if your resort covers a wide area then getting a small number of fast quads may be beneficial to ticket price."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the exploratory data analysis above. What numerical or categorical features were in the data? Was there any pattern suggested of a relationship between state and ticket price? What did this lead us to decide regarding which features to use in subsequent modeling? What aspects of the data (e.g. relationships between features) should you remain wary of when you come to perform feature selection for modeling? Two key points that must be addressed are the choice of target feature for your modelling and how, if at all, you're going to handle the states labels in the data."
